The file Earthy_ROM.bin is a binary image for the U430 M27C512-70XF1 EPROM (or AT27C512R-70PU OTP PROM).
I used 70ns parts, but I suspect that slower ones would also work.


It is built from the ROM images with revision code DD issued on 8 December 1986.
Revision code DD was the final firmware release issued for the 7071 and 7081 meters.

The CRC16 checksums is:
 
 U430	B100
