# Solartron 7071/7081 Replacement Earthy Processor Board

Sometime around 2020, I acquired a 7071 with a faulty "Brain" or "Earthy Processor" board.
I spent ages trying to fix it and in the end I just gave up on it, until I saw a topic on EEVBLOG started by Lucas Spitzkopf:

describing a two layer replacement PCB he had created for this.

This inspired me to create a four layer replacement board based upon his KiCad schematic, and this is the result.
